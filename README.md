# BouncingGame
Bouncing Game coming to Google Play Store near you!
This is a project independently created by Aaron Nhan '22
The purpose of this is to create a working application and hopefully upload it to the Google Play Store.


Bouncing Game has an outside-of-client customizable level system. The format is below

    <level>.txt
    Node: center_x, center_y, radius
    Obstacle: center_x, center_y
    Wall: center_x, center_y, width, height, angle



Special thanks to:

Professor Songwu Lu and Dr. Yuanjie Li for giving me the opportunity to intern at UCLA and giving me the
tools and knowledge to create this project on my own.

Ms. Kosbab for being an incredible Computer Science teacher for the past 4 years

Mr. Franco for helping with angle calculation formulas

Friends and Family who have supported me through the 2 months it took to make this

Anyone who downloads this and hopefully has fun playing it!
