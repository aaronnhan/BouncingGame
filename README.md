# BouncingGame

Update: The game is out!

Update 2: I have taken the game down because the Google Play Store and Apple App store require 64 bit binaries or annual developers fees. Please contact me if you would like a copy.
The game is available:

Bouncing Game coming to Google Play Store near you!
This is a project independently created by Aaron Nhan '22
The purpose of this is to create a working application and upload it to the Google Play Store/Apple App Store.


Bouncing Game has an out-of-client customizable level system. The format is below

    <level>.txt
    #Layout 1
    <Node_center_x, Node_center_y, Node_radius>|<Wall_center_x, Wall_center_y, Wall_width, Wall_height, Wall_angle>|<Laser_center_x, Laser_center_y, Laser_width, Laser_height>
    #Layout 2
    <Node_center_x, Node_center_y, Node_radius>|<Wall_center_x, Wall_center_y, Wall_width, Wall_height, Wall_angle>|<Laser_center_x, Laser_center_y, Laser_width, Laser_height>
