# BouncingGame
Bouncing Game coming to Google Play Store near you!
This is a project independently created by Aaron Nhan '22
The purpose of this is to create a working application and hopefully upload it to the Google Play Store.


Bouncing Game has an out-of-client customizable level system. The format is below

    <level>.txt
    #Layout 1
    <Node_center_x, Node_center_y, Node_radius>|<Wall_center_x, Wall_center_y, Wall_width, Wall_height, Wall_angle>|<Laser_center_x, Laser_center_y, Laser_width, Laser_height>
    #Layout 2
    <Node_center_x, Node_center_y, Node_radius>|<Wall_center_x, Wall_center_y, Wall_width, Wall_height, Wall_angle>|<Laser_center_x, Laser_center_y, Laser_width, Laser_height>


Special thanks to:
